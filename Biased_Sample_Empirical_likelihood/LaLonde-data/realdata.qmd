## Import Data


```{r}
library(cem)
data(LLvsPSID)  # Import LaLonde data
dat.raw  = LLvsPSID
head(dat.raw)
y0 = dat.raw$re78  # define real earnings in 1978
x0 = dat.raw$re75  # define real earnings in 1975
```

The response variable is `re78/10000`.

Let D = treated, We would like to estimate the average earnings of the treated in 1978: $\theta=E[Y(1)]$
